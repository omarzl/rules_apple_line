# LINE's Apple rules for Bazel ![](https://github.com/line/bazel_rules_apple/workflows/build/badge.svg)

This repository contains additional rules for Bazel that can be used to bundle
applications and frameworks for Apple platforms.

## Overview

These are open references of what are used to build the LINE iOS app, which
solve some of our specific use-cases, for instance, mixed Objective-C and Swift
modules. They can be used as drop-in replacements for the official Apple rules
when needed, with the goal of being easy to switch back to the official ones
when we longer need them.

They may not work with certain revisions of `rules_apple` or
`rules_swift` due to their breaking changes. If they don't work out-of-the-box
for you, use them as references for your custom rule's implementation.

## Build Definitions

### Library Rules

* [apple_library](docs/README.md#apple_library)
* [metal_library](docs/README.md#metal_library)
* [objc_library](docs/README.md#objc_library)
* [swift_library](docs/README.md#swift_library)

### Bundling Rules

* [mixed_static_framework](docs/README.md#mixed_static_framework)
* [objc_static_framework](docs/README.md#objc_static_framework)
* [swift_static_framework](docs/README.md#swift_static_framework)

### Other Rules

* [apple_linker_inputs](docs/README.md#apple_linker_inputs)
* [apple_preprocessed_plist](docs/README.md#apple_preprocessed_plist)
* [apple_resource_bundle](docs/README.md#apple_resource_bundle)
* [pkg_dsym](docs/README.md#pkg_dsym)
* [swiftgen](docs/README.md#swiftgen)

## Requirements

Bazel 4.0+

## Setup

- Setup [rules_apple](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple#quick-setup).

- Add the following to your `WORKSPACE` file, replacing `<commit>` with the
  commit you wish to depend on and `<sha256>` with the expected SHA-256 of the
  zip file.

```starlark
RULES_APPLE_LINE_COMMIT = "<commit>"

http_archive(
    name = "rules_apple_line",
    sha256 = "<sha256>",
    strip_prefix = "rules_apple_line-%s" % RULES_APPLE_LINE_COMMIT,
    url = "https://github.com/line/rules_apple_line/archive/%s.zip" % RULES_APPLE_LINE_COMMIT,
)

load(
    "@rules_apple_line//apple:repositories.bzl",
    "rules_apple_line_dependencies",
)

rules_apple_line_dependencies()
```
